# doggopvp-history
a collection of variations of doggopvp minecraft texture packs.
If you are using this texture pack for Minecraft and use it in videos or etc., please credit me and/or put a download link in the desc so everyone knows who made this and these texture packs.
Thanks for using DoggoPVP (at some point loldogpvp) and I hope you have a good time.
Please do not redistribute and put viruses in the packs, I worked really hard on them and wish for the work to not go to waste.

Oh yeah and I'm getting a bit tired of making edits to doggopvp because there's not much I'll need to edit anymore. So, soon I will be making a texture pack called Mainframe. See ya'll soon.
